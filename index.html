    <h1>Garrett Albright</h1>
    <p>&hellip;is a web developer currently living in Boise, Idaho. My most notable contribution to the web development world is the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/pathologic">Pathologic</a> module for the Drupal content management system, which is in use on over 68,000 sites as of the last time I checked. However, I&rsquo;ve also worked on a lot of other projects, including the Drupal project itself. (I even snuck an easter egg into the core codebase which is still there as of last check.) Aside from PHP, I also have been experimenting with Swift a lot recently.</p>
    <p>Distraught with drama and silliness in the PHP/Drupal ecosystem, I&rsquo;ve recently been working on stuff in other ecosystems under a new persona separate from my real name. (This also explains why this is just a flat HTML page rather than a Drupal site.) I still gotta pay the bills, though, so I still do PHP/Drupal work when it&rsquo;s available.</p>
    <p>I am currently available for contract work involving development in PHP (including Drupal or other systems) and Swift, front-end development with HTML 5, JavaScript, and CSS, and technical writing and general consulting. My rates are commiserate with my skill level and years of experience, and I offer discounts for payments in cryptocurrency form.</p>
    <p>I can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:contact@albright.pro">contact@albright.pro</a>.</p>
    <h2>Relevant links</h2>
    <p>Note that, as mentioned above, I have been releasing some of my newer work under an alias that I aim to keep disconnected from my real name, and thus isn't available to view at any of the links below. If you are earnestly soliciting me for hire, I can share this other work with you for review.</p>

    <h2>If you&rsquo;re such a good web developer, why is this site so bland?</h2>

I just don&rsquo;t want to work on my own site right now when there are more interesting projects I could be working on. Maybe some day, it will be more interesting.</p>
