    <h1>Garrett Albright</h1>
    <p>&hellip;is a web developer currently living in Boise, Idaho. My most notable contribution to the web development world is the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/pathologic">Pathologic</a> module for the Drupal content management system, which is in use on over 66,000 sites as of the last time I checked. However, I&rsquo;ve also worked on a lot of other things, including various issues and things with the Drupal project itself.</p>
    <p>However, I am currently on something of a sabbatical from Drupal development due to various reasons; one being an interest to learn more about other technologies, and another being disgust at the way the Drupal Association has behaved with regards to Larry &ldquo;Crell&rdquo; Garfield. If the Association is going to create an environment where someone of Crell&rsquo;s level of dedication and talent is not welcome, then I certainly don&rsquo;t feel welcome either. (I do feel flattered that the easter egg I snuck in the codebase a few years ago is still there, though.)</p>
    <p>The technologies I am developing in the sabbatical include iOS and macOS development with Swift. I still consider myself a newbie in regards to these technologies, but I feel that I am progressing rapidly.</p>
    <p>I am currently available for contract work involving development in PHP (including Drupal or other systems) and Swift, front-end development with HTML 5, JavaScript and CSS, and technical writing and general consulting. My hourly rates are competitive relative to my skill level in each field &mdash; in other words, I&rsquo;m a very cheap Swift developer! But if you are interested in hiring me for PHP work, please be willing to pay a fair price before contacting me.</p>
    <p>I can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:contact@albright.pro">contact@albright.pro</a>.</p>
    <h2>Relevant links</h2>
    <p>Note that, in light of the Crell incident, I have been releasing some of my newer work under an alias that I aim to keep disconnected from my real name, and thus isn't available at any of the links below. If you are earnestly soliciting me for hire, I can share this other work with you for review.</p>

    <h2>If you&rsquo;re such a good web developer, why is this site so bland?</h2>

I just don&rsquo;t want to work on my own site right now when there are more interesting projects I could be working on. Maybe some day, it will be more interesting.</p>
