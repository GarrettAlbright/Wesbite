    <h1>Garrett Albright</h1>
    <p><img src="headshot.jpeg" width="200" height="200" id="headshot" alt="A somewhat outdated headshot" />Hello! I&rsquo;m a web developer currently living in Boise, Idaho. My most notable contribution to the web development world is the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/pathologic">Pathologic</a> module for the Drupal content management system, which is in use on over 68,000 sites as of the last time I checked. However, I&rsquo;ve also worked on a lot of other projects, including the Drupal project itself. (I even snuck an easter egg into the core codebase which is still there as of last check.)</p>
    <p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://www.gamerguides.com">Gamer Guides</a>, where I&rsquo;ve implemented ePub and PDF export of their guides, implemented interactive maps showing the position of in-game items, maintained payment processor integration, and more.</p>
    <p>I am currently available for contract work involving development in PHP (including Drupal or other systems) and Swift, front-end development with HTML 5, JavaScript, and CSS, and technical writing and general consulting. My rates are fair for my skill level and years of experience, and I offer discounts for early payment and/or payment in cryptocurrency form.</p>
    <p>I can be reached via email at <a href="mailto:contact@albright.pro">contact@albright.pro</a>.</p>
